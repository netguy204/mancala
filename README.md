Mancala, in your Browser
========================

The rules:

On your turn, you may play (by touching) any of the small positions of your color. Your pieces will be distributed counter-clockwise around the board from that position.

The larger positions are the scoring positions. Your goal is to get as many pieces into your scoring position as possible.

If the last piece you distribute lands in a scoring position then you get an extra move.

If the last piece you distribute lands in one of your empty positions then you steal all of your opponites pieces in the opposite position.
